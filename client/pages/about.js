        <p>I'm a full-stack developer. I enjoy games, snowboarding, and hanging out with my beautiful family. I spend my time creating things that make people's lives better and teaching others about the magic of code. I also host a tech podcast called Status Code, write a lot of articles, contribute to open source, and speak about CSS, JavaScript, and web accessibility. I currently live in Madison, WI, but I've lived all over the U.S.! Don't hesitate to reach out! <span aria-label="Emoji of a happy face with hearts for eyes" role="img">üòç</span></p>
